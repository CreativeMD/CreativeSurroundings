**What's New**
* Changed from having a separate coremod to using the Sponge Mixin framework.  (Why didn't I do this sooner?)
     * Change should be transparent.  If you have a problem open an issue in the tracker.
* Eliminated AT transforms.
     * Change should be transparent.  If you have a problem open an issue in the tracker.
* Option to turn off the potion icon display to the left of the inventory screen.  You will have to enable.  Option is under the ASM options in the config.

* Gave auroras some TLC:
     * Render optimizations both in code and shader - big improvements.
     * Added config option to cap number of bands.  The default is max of 3 bands but can be turned down to 1 for potatoes.
     * I have a GTX 980 and I can drive a 3 band aurora at 120FPS.
* Updates for biome sounds to clean up some high frequency noise (thanks TechnoMysterio!)
     * Savanna Day, Forest, Bog, and Wind

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.4.0
**Requires OreLib-1.12.2-3.5.1.3!**

**What's New**
* Allow the mod to be installed on the server but not on the client.  This allows a player to remove DS from their client in the case of having a potato for CPU/GPU.  For this to work the server would have to have v3.5.4.0 installed.
* Bubbles breath effect when under water.  Small bubble trail leaves an entities mouth and travels upwards a short ways.  Bigger less frequent bubbles when drowning.

**Fixes**
* Fixed compatibility with Vivecraft
* Fixed occasional waterfall sound errors

**Changes**
* Removed ASM for sound timing.
* Reworked some of the internal sound handling.

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.2.0
**What's New**
* Added "alwaysOutside" dimension config attribute.  This tells Dynamic Surroundings to always consider the player outside while in that dimension.  Affects biome sound selection.
* Improved Erebus support.  Biome sounds while in the Erebus.  (See first bullet.)
* ru_ru translations for Entity Chat.  (Thanks VoltoREv!)

**Fixes**
* Immersive Engineering item equip sounds.
* Reinitialize the DS ItemRegistry on the fly because some mod modified the Forge item registry after Dynamic Surroundings scanned them.
* Abstract method error loading resources from resource pack.
* Defensive code when processing ore dictionary entries where it encounters a block that is not registered.

**Changes**
* Move DS registry initialization to load complete rather than post init.

    * Goal is to make the ripple more Minecraft like
* If Serene Seasons is installed morning fog may be more/less foggier during certain seasons.

**Changes**
* Only render rain splash particles if world weather renderer is hooked by Dynamic Surroundings
    * Otherwise vanilla will render the splash particles
    * Should improve compatibility with other mods that replace the weather renderer
* Added additional transitions to precipitation textures to make it a bit smoother
* Recolor rain/splash textures to use vanilla rain pixel colors
* Rework drip effect to generate steam when hitting hot blocks, like magma.

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.0.5

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.0.2
**What's New**

    * This shouldn't affect things if you do not use Serene Seasons
    * It also affects things like frog croaks and fireflies

**Fixes**
* Footstep sound on thin LittleTile block was incorrect.

**Changes**
* Cap hurt threshold percentage at 50% of max health 

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.0.1
**Fixes**
* Fixed NPE processing blockstate bounding box
* Fixed compatbility issue with World Downloader mod that caused it to crash
* Fixed NPE getting data from BlockStateRegistry 
* Compatibility with latest Serene Seasons.  If you use Serene Seasons it must be at least version 1.2.10!

### DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.5.0.0
This release is a major update to Dynamic Surroundings.  Make sure you make backups of your Minecraft
instance.  You will need to reset your Dynamic Surroundings config file and re-apply your changes.

The format of the external Json configuration file has changed enough where you will need to rework
it to be compatible.  Tutorials on the changes can be found on the wiki.

With this release there is a dependency on an external library JAR.  Make sure that is installed
as well.

**What's New**
* New wiki can be found at https://dynamicsurroundings.readthedocs.io
* New deep forest day and night biome sounds.  Applies to Roofed Forest as well as some Birch Forest variants.
* Support Tetra mod.
* Footstep sounds on LittleTile blocks.
* Footstep sounds on ForgeMultipart blocks.
* Cosmetic Armor Reworked compatibility.  Use rendered armor model as the basis for selecting armor acoustic accents when moving.
* Improved compatibility with Just Enough Dimensions.
* Moved Battle Music into a resource pack.  As a result resource packs can be made for Dynamic Surroundings.
* Moved critical hit power words into an external file so they are now translatable.
* Added 2 new sound categories for controlling sound volume of biome and footstep sounds.  These will show up in the sound volume control dialog.
* Cleaned up mod configuration file.
* Cleaned up expression variables.

**Fixes**
* Client should no longer crash if there is a mod dependency issue.
* Render of modded potion icons in potion HUD display.
* Reload biome registry whenever a world loads.  Should address issues with OTG/Biome Bundle.
* Eliminated MusicTicker replacement.  Should improve improve compatibility with other mods that deal with the ticker.

**Changes**
* Removed reset rain on sleep configuration option.  It was little used and broadly improves compatibility because it eliminates some ASM.
* Removed rain control parameters.  These options were seldom used and materially impacted gameplay.
* Removed Albedo support.  Looking for a library replacement.
* Removed sound routing.  Crafting sounds for other players will not be heard.
* Removed Entity Emojis.  Little used feature.
* Removed explosion enhancements.  Caused too much lag with large explosions.
* Removed Presets!  If there is enough demand I can roll it into a separate mod.

**Other**
* Split library functions into a separate JAR (OreLib).
* There were a lot of internal changes made to restructure the mod and to support block variants rather than block metadata.
* Moved away from Trove collections to FastUtil collections.
* Improved validation of Json configuration files during load.
